This is a test project using the Discord js framework Sheweny

This bot is the new bot i'm working on to replace Roomba.
It will have a better structure and will provide more functionalities like slash command, buttons, etc...
I will create a music system from scratch as well as an automatic moderation system.
It will also implement an internal REST API to interface the bot with a web/mobile application
